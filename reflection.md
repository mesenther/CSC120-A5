- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think association can drastically improve programming efficiency and readability, as it allows a large program to be divided into smaller, more understandable classes with their own methods. Splitting up parts into classes also allows for individual parts to be accessed by some other program (ex. instead of Scarecrow, Human calls Shirt) without having to rewrite any code.

This project overall went pretty well for me. There were only a few things that took some time to fix, like the alignment of the shirt and pants, and inserting the right amount of \ characters. I also originally put the banner message as a parameter to the Scarecrow constructor, before realizing that didn't work since the message had to be input into the parameter of main(). 

I would recommend that someone else taking this course creates "placeholder" art for the Shirt, Pants, etc. and then focuses their time on the coding parts. So then, if they don't have much time, they can just use very simple art without having to worry about whether the program will compile.
